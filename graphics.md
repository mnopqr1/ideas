# Graphics learning resources

Many of these resources were recommended by Recursers in the Zulip game-dev stream.

* [Ray-tracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

* Physically based rendering course at TU Wien:

  * [First lecture of a course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sY_hoh_IDc)
  * [Course webpage](https://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/courses/Rendering/VU/2021S)

* Nori: [an educational ray-tracer](https://wjakob.github.io/nori/), used in the above course

* [The graphics codex](https://graphicscodex.com/)
  looks like a very nice and personal and pleasantly idiosyncratic book

* [Physically based rendering: theory to implementation](https://www.pbrt.org/) and [Real-Time Rendering 4th ed](http://www.realtimerendering.com/index.html) : these seem to be two of the "serious reference manuals" at the time of writing.

* [The book of shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com) was the first time I fell in love with graphics and the instant gratification it provides.

* [Computer graphics from scratch](https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/) my second graphics love, which shows that you can do ray tracing in the browser in a day.

* [Scratch a pixel](https://www.scratchapixel.com) looks really cute and home-grown

* [Very extensive (bit dated?) set of resources](https://github.com/miloyip/game-programmer), much wider than just graphics

* [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) seems to have a more top-down approach.

* Not strictly graphics but the [Godot project](https://godotengine.org/) looks really sympathetic. Although apparently if the goal is to get a job, one needs to [learn Unity](https://learn.unity.com/).
