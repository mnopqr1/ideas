# Programming wishlist

A list of ideas and things I'd like to do, explore, learn, when I have the time. Started on a piece of paper during my batch at the [Recurse center](https://www.recurse.com) and continued since then. 

Beware, the projects range from "finishing something long overdue" to "learning a whole new part of CS". I have tried to divide them into the time estimated it would take, at least initially. There's a good chance that if I like the project, then I'd work on it a lot longer. This is not a *to-do list* but a *things-I-know-I-can-get-excited-about list*.

Some of these might be interesting for other people to think about (together?!), some less so. If you see something you want to chat about, contact me via [e-mail](mailto:mnopqr1@pm.me) or on the RC zulip (probably faster).

## A few hours

* Write a blog about what I learned from [doing assignments from the Stanford visual recognition course](https://cs231n.github.io)

* Write a blog about what I learned from the [Fast.ai course](https://course.fast.ai)

## A goal for a day

* Deploy my [Re-codenames app](https://github.com/mnopqr1/recodenames).

* Find a way to deploy the [city recognizer](https://github.com/mnopqr1/cityrecognizer) without having to use the Voila - Binder stack.

* Visualizing gradient descent in the browser

* Fork and improve a [command line interface for WaniKani](https://community.wanikani.com/t/wanikani-cli-typescript-api-library/39824/6) (or build one from scratch, diving into [their API](https://docs.api.wanikani.com/)?)

* Write a program that implements the first obvious idea that comes to mind for the [Hutter prize](http://prize.hutter1.net/) and test how badly (or well??) it does

* Writing assignment: grokking deep learning without using ANY matrices.

Linear algebra is not about matrices but about linear transformations of space. Matrices are just the numeric representation of these transformations. It is also possible to understand what the stack and heap are without writing assembly code. So why are neural networks taught with matrix multiplication?! (This is an idea that I need to develop further, this is just the pitch.)

* Visualizing the Fourier transform, following along with [this coding challenge](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/125-fourier-series.html)

* Play the [natural numbers game](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) and understand how to get a simple math proof to work in [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/)

* Understand what [CRDTs are and what they have to do with semilattices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOlnp2bZVRs)

* Read classical papers in CS such as Turing's. With an RC reading group?

## A few days of playing around

* The [Nand2Tetris operating system project](https://www.nand2tetris.org/project12)

* A project for a friend who wants to simulate natural lighting as part of an art project

* The basics of computer security with the challenges in [this cute course](https://pwn.college)

* Write a homegrown spaced repetition system, a clone of  [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with a friendlier interface.

* [Ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). I collected [more graphics learning resources](graphics.md) on a separate page.

## A week of hard focused work, or more

* Deep dive into compilers: the [Wirth book](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/CompilerConstruction/) and/or [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

* A do-it-myself version of one of the [David Beazley](https://www.dabeaz.com/) or [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com/) courses: reserve a week of working full-time on only one thing.

* Get ready to teach PyTorch and develop appealing course materials for that.

* Get ready to teach OCaml and develop appealing course materials for that.

* Meta: do something from [this list](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x)

Credit: many of these ideas came from chats and pairing with various Recursers, but I haven't kept a record of what reference came from whom. Do reach out to me if you want to be credited for something! I got the idea for [an ideas list repo](https://github.com/captn3m0/ideas) from Nemo.
